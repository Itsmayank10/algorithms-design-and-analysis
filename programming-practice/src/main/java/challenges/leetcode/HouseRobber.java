/**
 * 198. House Robber
 * 
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you 
 * from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were 
 * broken into on the same night.
 * 
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without 
 * alerting the police.
